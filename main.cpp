// the code is slightly different than the assignment, I'm sorry, but next time I'll try to limit myself to the assignment
// I've made a deck of cards to work with that gets shuffeled and you draw from the top
// this is because I wanted to print the cards to screen to make it feel a little more like blackjack

// I wanted to challenge myself, but I have not looked up any solutions for any of the full functions, methods or the full game online
// I've only looked at documentation for specific things such as how to get a random number, how to use classes, vectors etc

// I've tried fixing the mistakes I made from last compulsory, mainly the text in the headers and trying to use classes
// I've still got a long way to go but I'm trying to get a hang of it.
